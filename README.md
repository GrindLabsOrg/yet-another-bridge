## Ok, but how does it work?

YAB is conformed primarily by 2 Smart Contracts, one Smart Contract on L1 ETH blockchain (called [YABTransfer](contracts/solidity/src/YABTransfer.sol)), and one Smart Contract on L2 Starknet blockchain (called [Escrow](contracts/cairo/src/escrow.cairo)). Another vital entity for YAB's functionality is the Market Maker (MM for short).

And, of course, the users.

- To the user, the process is as follows:

    1. The user want to bridge L2 ETH tokens from Starknet to L1 Ethereum
    2. The user deposits ETH tokens on L2 Escrow, while also sending some extra information; such as where does the user want to recieve the money on L1, how much fee does he want to give to the Market Maker, etc. So the user sends to the Escrow the amount plus a fee
    3. The user recieves in his L1 wallet a transaction of the amount sent to Escrow from a YABTransfer's address

    Done, the User has bridged tokens from L2 to L1, in the time it takes to complete 2 simple transactions.

- For a MM, the process is as follows:

    1. The MM holds his ETH tokens on his own private L1 wallet
    2. The MM monitors Escrow's activity logs and events, to detect any Users wanting to bridge tokens
    3. MM detects a User that has transferred ETH tokens to L2 Escrow, and decides the amount to bridge with the transfer fee is acceptable
    4. MM sends the ETH tokens on L1 to YABTransfer, specifying the User's orderID, L1 recipient address and amount.
    5. Then, YABTransfer sends the ETH tokens to the User, and generates a storage proof, proving the User has received the appropriate funds, and sends this proof to L2 Escrow
    6. Escrow validates this storage proof, and sends the ETH Tokens (plus fees) to MM's L2 wallet.

    Done, MM has sent ETH to a L1 address, and recieved same ETH plus fees on L2.

The whole process is shown in the following diagram:

## Risks

### User

For the user, the only risk is the existance of a bug in the code of the smart contracts. This risk is mitigated by having very simple, and thoroughly tested, smart contracts.

### Market Makers

The risk taken by market makers is the same than by the users, plus the fact that in the end, MM will end up with its value in a L2; which are less battle-tested and have less guarantees.

Additionally, since the capital is locked for a short period of time, the associated risks are mitigated. By minimizing the value held within the smart contracts, these becomes less appealing as a target to potential attackers, thereby significantly reducing its attractiveness as a potential exploit.

# This Project

In this repo you will find both Smart Contracts, L1 [YABTransfer contract](contracts/solidity/src/YABTransfer.sol) (written in Solidity) and L2 [Escrow contract](contracts/cairo/src/escrow.cairo) (written in Cairo), and a MM-bot (written in Python).

Both the [contracts](contracts/README.md) and the [MM-bot](mm-bot/README.md) have their own README, to deploy and use them correctly.

## Prerequisites

To make this project work, you must have installed the following:

- Python: to execute MM-bot
- Scarb: Cairo and Starknet toolchain
- Starkli: CLI tool for interating with Starknet blockchain
- Starknet Foundry: for building, testing and developing Starknet contracts
- Ethereum Foundry: for building, testing and developing Ethereum contracts

All these are installed with `make deps`.

## Escrow

[Escrow](contracts/cairo/src/escrow.cairo) is a Smart Contract written in Cairo that resides in Ethereum's L2 Starknet.

This contract is responsable for recieving Users' payments in L2, and liberating them to the MM when, and only when, the MM has proved the L1 payment.

This contract has a storage of all orders. When a new order is made, by calling the `set_order` function, this contract reads the new order's details, verifies the Order is acceptable, and if so, it stores this data and accepts from the sendes the appropriate amount of tokens. An Order's details are: the address where the User wants to recieve the transaction on L1, the amount he wants to recieve, and the amount he is willing to give the MM to concrete the bridge process.

Once Escrow has accepted the new order, it will emit a `SetOrder` event, containing this information so that MMs can decide if they want to accept this offer.

The user must wait until a MM picks it's order, which should be almost instantaneous if the transfer fee is the suggested one! If the order is not chosen by any MM for the minimum wait time (which is currently 12 hours), the user may call the `cancel_order` function from the same address who requested the bridge. While doing this, if the correct information is provided to Escrow, it will cancel the order and return the funds to the user.

After a MM consolidates an order, Escrow will recieve a `withdraw` call from YABTransfer, containing the information about how MM has indeed bridged the funds to the User's L1 address, and where does MM want to recieve it's L2 tokens. Escrow will then cross check this information to its own records, and if everything is in check, Escrow will transfer the bridged amount of tokens, plus the fee, to MM's L2 address.

## YABTransfer

[YABTransfer](contracts/solidity/src/YABTransfer.sol) is a Smart Contract that resides in Ethereum's L1, responsable for receiving MM's transaction on L1, forwarding it to the User's address, and sending the information of this transaction to Escrow.

So, when MM wants to complete an order it has read on Escrow, it will call the `transfer` function from YABTransfer, containing the relevant information (orderID, User's address on L1, and amount). YABTransfer will verify the information is acceptable (the amount is enough, the orderID has not already been closed, etc), store it, and send the desired amount to User's L1 address.

After this transfer is completed, MM must call `withdraw` function on YABTransfer to withdraw its funds, so that YABTransfer can verify MM has previously sent the order's amount to the User. If it has, this same function will call Escrow's `withdraw` function, informing Escrow that MM has indeed bridged funds for User, and that he wants to withdraw his amount on L2. Then, as mentioned before, Escrow will release MM's funds to his desired L2 address.

## MM-bot

[MM-bot](mm-bot/src/main.py) (written in Python) is a complex script responsable of being the Market Maker of YAB.

When run, MM-bot constantly reads Escrow's events and stores them in its own database; With this, the bot can detect almost instantaneously when a user creates a new order, allowing it to be the one who bridges the tokens for the user.

It reads every new order's information, analyzes if it capable of completing such order, and, if so, it makes the transfer to YABTransfer using the funds available on its L1 address. After this transfer is complete, MM-bot will execute the appropriate withdraw so that it can regain its tokens on L2.

MM-bot has a L1 address to transfer funds to YABTransfer (as stated above), and a L2 address to recieve the L2 tokens after succesfully completing the bridge. Also, if MM-bot is shut down, and Escrow recieves new orders, MM-bot will identify these orders when turned back on, and will identify which of them are still open, so he can complete them.
