## Deploy YABTransfer (on Ethereum)

First, the Ethereum smart contract must be deployed. For Ethereum the deployment process you will need to:

1. Create your `.env` file: you need to configure the following variables in your own .env file on the contracts/solidity/ folder. You can use the env.example file as a template for creating your .env file, paying special attention to the formats provided

   ```bash
   ETH_RPC_URL = Infura or Alchemy RPC URL

   ETH_PRIVATE_KEY = private key of your ETH wallet

   ETHERSCAN_API_KEY = API Key to use etherscan to read the Ethereum blockchain

   SN_MESSAGING_ADDRESS = Starknet Messaging address
   ```

   **NOTE**:

   - You can generate ETHERSCAN_API_KEY [following this steps](https://docs.etherscan.io/getting-started/creating-an-account).
   - For the deploy, you will need some GoerliETH that you can get from this [faucet](https://goerlifaucet.com/).
   - Current SN_MESSAGING_ADDRESS values:
   - SN_MESSAGING_ADDRESS is for when a L1 contract initiates a message to a L2 contract on Starknet. It does so by calling the sendMessageToL2 function on the Starknet Core Contract with the message parameters. Starknet Core Contracts are the following:
      - Goerli: `0xde29d060D45901Fb19ED6C6e959EB22d8626708e`
      - Sepolia: `0xE2Bb56ee936fd6433DC0F6e7e3b8365C906AA057`
      - Mainnet: `0xc662c410C0ECf747543f5bA90660f6ABeBD9C8c4`

2. Deploy Solidity contract

   ```bash
      make ethereum-deploy
   ```

This will deploy a [ERC1967 Proxy](https://docs.openzeppelin.com/contracts/4.x/api/proxy#ERC1967Proxy) smart contract, a [YABTransfer](solidity/src/YABTransfer.sol) smart contract, and it will link them both. The purpose of having a proxy in front of our smart contract is so that it is [upgradeable](https://docs.openzeppelin.com/contracts/4.x/api/proxy#UUPSUpgradeable), by simply deploying another smart contract and changing the address pointed by the Proxy.

## Deploy Escrow (on Starknet)

After the Ethereum smart contract is deployed, the Starknet smart contracts must be declared and deployed.
On Starknet, the deployment process is in two steps:

- Declaring the class of your contract, or sending your contractâ€™s code to the
  network
- Deploying a contract or creating an instance of the previously declared code
  with the necessary parameters

For this, you will need to:

1. Create your `.env` file: you need to configure the following variables in your own .env file on the contracts/solidity folder. You can use the env.example file as a template for creating your .env file, paying special attention to the formats provided

   ```env
   STARKNET_ACCOUNT = Absolute path of your starknet testnet account

   STARKNET_KEYSTORE = Absolute path of your starknet testnet keystore

   SN_RPC_URL = Infura or Alchemy RPC URL

   SN_ESCROW_OWNER = Public address of the owner of the Escrow contract

   MM_SN_WALLET_ADDR = Starknet wallet of the MarketMaker

   WITHDRAW_NAME = The exact plain name of the withdraw function that is called from L1, case sensitive

   MM_ETHEREUM_WALLET = Ethereum wallet of the MarketMaker

   NATIVE_TOKEN_ETH_STARKNET = Ethereum's erc20 token handler contract in Starknet
   ```

   **Note**
   - For how to create Starknet ACCOUNT and KEYSTORE, you can follow [this tutorial](starknet_wallet_setup.md)
   - SN_ESCROW_OWNER is the only one who can perform upgrades, pause and unpause the smart contract. If not defined, this value will be set (by deploy.sh) to the current deployer of the smart contract.

2. Declare and Deploy: We sequentially declare and deploy the contracts, and connect it to our Ethereum smart contract.

### First alternative: automatic deploy and connect of Escrow and YABTransfer

   ```bash
      make starknet-deploy-and-connect
   ```

   This make target consists of 4 steps:

   1. make starknet-build; builds the project
   2. make starknet-deploy; deploys the smart contract on the blockchain
   3. make ethereum-set-escrow; sets the newly created Starknet contract address on the Ethereum smart contract, so that the L1 contract can communicate with the L2 contract
   4. make ethereum-set-withdraw-selector; sets the Starknet _withdraw_ function name on the Ethereum smart contract, so that the L1 contract can communicate with the L2 contract

### Second alternative: manual deploy and connect of Escrow and YABTransfer

This may be better suited for you if you plan to change some of the automatically declared variables, or if you simply want to make sure you understand the process.

1. Declare and Deploy: We sequentially declare and deploy the contracts.

   ```bash
      make starknet-deploy
   ```

   This script also defines an important variable, **ESCROW_CONTRACT_ADDRESS**

2. Setting _EscrowAddress_

   After the Starknet smart contracts are declared and deployed, the variable _EscrowAddress_ from the Ethereum smart contract must be updated with the newly created Starknet smart contract address.

   To do this, you can use

   ```bash
   make ethereum-set-escrow
   ```

   This script uses the previously set variable, **ESCROW_CONTRACT_ADDRESS**

3. Setting _EscrowWithdrawSelector_

   Ethereum's smart contract has another variable that must be configured, _EscrowWithdrawSelector_, which is for specifying the _withdraw_ function's name in the Starknet Escrow smart contract.
   You can set and change Ethereum's _EscrowWithdrawSelector_ variable, doing the following:

   ```bash
   make ethereum-set-withdraw-selector
   ```

   This script uses the WITHDRAW_NAME .env variable to automatically generate the selector in the necesary format

## Recap

At this point, we should have deployed an ETH smart contract as well as declared and deployed a Starknet smart contract, both connected to act as a bridge between these two chains.

## Upgrade Contracts in Testnet

### Upgrading YABTransfer (on Ethereum)

After deploying the `YABTransfer` contract, you can perform upgrades to it. To do this you must:

1. Configure the `contracts/solidity/.env` file.

   ```env
      ETH_RPC_URL = Infura or Alchemy RPC URL

      ETH_PRIVATE_KEY = private key of your ETH wallet

      ETHERSCAN_API_KEY = API Key to use etherscan to read the Ethereum blockchain

      SN_MESSAGING_ADDRESS = Starknet Messaging address
   ```

   **NOTE:** This is a very similar configuration than the mentioned before, but MM_ETHEREUM_WALLET is not necessary

2. Configure the address of the proxy to be upgraded:

   ```b
      export YAB_TRANSFER_PROXY_ADDRESS = Address of your YABTransfer's Proxy
   ```

3. Use the Makefile command to upgrade `YABTransfer` contract

   ```bash
      make ethereum-upgrade
   ```

   **Note**
   - You must be the **owner** of the contract to upgrade it.
   - This command will:
      - Rebuild `YABTransfer.sol`
      - Deploy the new contract to the network
      - Utilize Foundry to upgrade the previous contract, changing the proxy's pointing address to the newly deployed contract

### Upgrade Escrow (on Starknet)

If you wish to upgrade any previously deployed `Escrow` contract, it is possible through a command. We will perform the upgrade using the `starkli` tool, so the same configuration used for deployment is necessary:

1. Configure `contracts/cairo/.env` file.

   ```env
      STARKNET_ACCOUNT = Path of your starknet testnet account

      STARKNET_KEYSTORE = Path of your starknet testnet keystore
   ```

2. Configure the address of the contract to be upgraded:

   ```bash
      export ESCROW_CONTRACT_ADDRESS = Address of your Escrow smart contract
   ```

3. Use the Makefile command to upgrade `Escrow` contract

   ```bash
      make starknet-upgrade
   ```

   **Note**

- You must be the **owner** of the contract to upgrade it.
- This command will:
  - **rebuild** `Escrow.cairo`
  - **declare** it on Starknet
  - Call the external **upgrade()** function with the new class hash

### Pausable

Escrow also implements the interesting `Pauseable` module. This means the smart contract can be paused and unpaused by the smart contract Owner. When paused, all modifying functions are unavailable for everyone, including the Owner.

For this, the Owner must execute the `pause` or `unpause` function from the smart contract.

todo: add a make target for this
