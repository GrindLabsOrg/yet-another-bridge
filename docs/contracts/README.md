# Contracts

YAB is conformed primarily by two Smart Contracts, one Smart Contract on L1 ETH blockchain 
(called [Payment Registry](../../contracts/solidity/src/PaymentRegistry.sol)), and one
Smart Contract on L2 Starknet blockchain 
(called [Escrow](../../contracts/cairo/src/escrow.cairo)). Another vital entity for 
YAB's functionality is the Market Maker (MM for short).

In the following sections, you will find information about:
- [Escrow](escrow.md)
- [Payment Registry](payment_registry.md)
- [Deploy](deploy.md)
- [Upgrade Contract](upgrade.md)
- [Pause Contract](pause.md)
